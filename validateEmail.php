Step 2 -- Check the e-mail address format
Next, you'll use our regular expression to determine if the e-mail address is properly formatted. If the e-mail address is not valid, return in error:

    return $result;
}
/*
Step 3 -- Find the address of the mail server
Now, split apart the e-mail address and use the domain name to search for a mail server you can use to further check the e-mail address. 
If no mail server is found, you'll just use the domain address as a mail server address:
Note: In the event that the optional step 4 is not followed, the else portion of this step must return in error in order for the script to function properly.

/* 
Step 4 -- Connect to mail server and check e-mail address (OPTIONAL)
Finally, once you have the best guess at a mail server, it's time to open a connection
and talk to the server. As I stated earlier, this step is optional.
After every command you send, you'll need to read a kilobyte (1024 bytes) of data
from the server. It should be more than enough to receive
the complete response from the server for that command.
Note that you'll store the output from the server in three separate variables: 
$To, $From and $Out. This is done so you can check the responses after you close the connection,
to see if you actually have a real e-mail address or not. 
If the script cannot connect at all, or the e-mail address wasn't valid, 
set the $result array to the proper values:
*/
/*
	$Connect = @fsockopen ( $ConnectAddress, 25 );
	if ($Connect)
	{
		if (ereg("^220", $Out = fgets($Connect, 1024)))
		{
			fputs ($Connect, "HELO $HTTP_HOST\r\n"); 
			$Out = fgets ( $Connect, 1024 ); 
			fputs ($Connect, "MAIL FROM: <{$Email}>\r\n"); 
			$From = fgets ( $Connect, 1024 ); 
			fputs ($Connect, "RCPT TO: <{$Email}>\r\n"); 
			$To = fgets ($Connect, 1024); 
			fputs ($Connect, "QUIT\r\n"); 
			fclose($Connect); 
			if (!ereg ("^250", $From) || !ereg ( "^250", $To ))
			{
				$result[0]=false; 
				$result[1]="Server rejected address"; 
				return $result;
			} 
		}
		else
		{
			$result[0] = false; 
			$result[1] = "No response from server"; 
			return $result; 
          }
	}
	else
	{
        $result[0]=false; 
        $result[1]="Can not connect E-Mail server."; 
        return $result; 
    } 
*/
/*
Step 5 -- Return the results
Finally, our last and easiest step is to return the results and finish:
*/
    $result[0]=true; 
    $result[1]="$Email appears to be valid."; 
    return $result;
