Find bellow a synthesis for using, focusing the main parameters envolved on searching an image in the Catalog.  
</h3>
<br> 
<p>
You can define, on the panel at the left, instances for basic and specific parameters to guide the searches in the Catalog.
<br>
Basic parameters are :
<br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>Satellite</b> - select a satellite or leave the "blank field" to get all of them.
<br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>Instrument</b> - once you have chosen a specific satellite, a specific instrument (camera) of this satellite can be selected 
or, if selected,  the "blank field" will provide all the instruments.
<br> 
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>Time Interval</b> - you can choose a straight time interval (e.g. from 10/03/1998 to 20/05/2003) or a <u>Seasonal</u> interval
(that DOES NOT TAKE the days into account, ONLY the values of the months of the time interval) meaning that, for the same period (from 10/03/1998 to 20/05/2003) only images received from march to may of years from 1998 to 2003 
will be selected.
<br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>Maximum Cloud Cover</b> - you can define, for each quarter of the image, an index reflecting the maximum cloud cover 
for your search ; if left "blank", this instance will mean that any cloud cover index will be considered for the search criteria. 
<br>
The Quarters Definition :
<div><center><table>
<tr>
<td>Q1</td><td>Q2</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Q3</td><td>Q4</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center></div> 
<br>
These are the basic parameters. You have four kinds of queries to attend to your needs. Remember : for all kinds of 
queries, basic parameters might be taken for granted.
<br><br>
<center><h3>Search modes</h3></center>
<br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>By Municipality</b> - if you have the name of the municipality of your interest, you can enter it in the "Municipality" field 
to guide your search ; the same proceeding applys to the field "State" and "Country". Clicking a given municipality in the resulting list
(after executing your query), will lead you to a graphical interface where the municipality is geographically emphasized 
by a red circle. Available images will be represented by an "X" standing for the center of each image. 
<br><br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>By Path/Row</b> - satellites have reference systems based on paths and rows. For instance, the city of Brasilia is
located at path 157 and row 118 for the CBERS2 satellite. If you know the path and row of your interest, you can enter them 
in the field <b>From</b> and click on execute. If you want to search for a range of paths and rows, you may enter the smaller 
value in the field <b>From</b> and the larger one in the field <b>To</b> and click execute to run your query.
<br><br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>By Region</b> - if you have a region defined by its geographic coodinates (latitude and longitude), you may enter the 
North latitude in the field <b>North</b>, the South latitude in the field <b>South</b>, the West longitude in the field 
<b>West</b> and the East longitude in the field <b>East</b> and click the execute button to run your query.

<br><br>
<li style="font-size:15">
<b>Graphic Interface</b> - if you want to sail geographically, you may enter your central point coordinates (latitude 
and longitude) in the fields <b>Lat</b> and <b>Long</b> (of Map Interface) and click execute. You will get a graphic backgrounded image interface 
covered by the local map with names of cities on the vicinity for your orientation. You will get to move the showed area by 
clicking on the direction buttons at the enclosing border of the frame.
